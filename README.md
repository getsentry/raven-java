> Looking for Android? This repo has the stable, long term support Android SDK. Please note that Sentry has been working on a new [Sentry unified SDK](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/09/19/new-sdks-unified-python-javascript-dotnet-rust) with things like NDK support and much more. The first [preview is out, in a separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android/releases), published to bintray, jcenter and we're looking for feedback.

This is the Java SDK for [Sentry](https://sentry.io/). It provides out-of-the-box support for
many popular JVM based frameworks and libraries, including Android, Log4j, Logback, and more.

In most cases using one of the existing integrations is preferred, but Sentry additionally provides
a low level client for manually building and sending events to Sentry that can be used in any JVM
based application.

> The package [sentry-android-gradle-plugin was moved to its own repository.](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android-gradle-plugin).
